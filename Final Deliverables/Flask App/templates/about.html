        <p class="about">Flight Delay Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
            Over the last twenty years, air travel has been increasingly preferred among travelers, mainly because of
            its speed and in some cases comfort. This has led to phenomenal growth in air traffic and on the ground. An
            increase in air traffic growth has also resulted in massive levels of aircraft delays on the ground and in
            the air. These delays are responsible for large economic and environmental losses. The main objective of the
            model is to predict flight delays accurately in order to optimize flight operations and minimize delays.

            Using a machine learning model, we can predict flight arrival delays. The input to our algorithm is rows of
            feature vector like departure date, departure delay, distance between the two airports, scheduled arrival
            time etc. We then use decision tree classifier to predict if the flight arrival will be delayed or not. A
            flight is considered to be delayed when difference between scheduled and actual arrival times is greater
            than 15 minutes. Furthermore, we compare decision tree classifier with logistic regression and a simple
            neural network for various figures of merit.</p>
